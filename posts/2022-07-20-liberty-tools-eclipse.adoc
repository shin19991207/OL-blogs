== Liberty Dashboard
The Liberty Dashboard keeps all of your Maven and Gradle projects organized and is automatically populated with projects that are configured to run with Open Liberty. With a few clicks, you can start and stop your app, run tests and view test reports. 

== Dev Mode

Liberty Dev mode (link) automatically picks up your code changes and deploys them to your running app all without having to restart the server. With Liberty Tools,Â  your app starts in dev mode automatically giving you all of the benefits of faster development. 

== Language Server Integration

< Fix up this section > 

Configuring your Liberty server is now simpler than ever with new server config autocomplete, validation and feature suggestions.

Quickly and easily develop MicroProfile applications with autocomplete, suggested code snippets and real time validation. 


== Try it out

The Dashboard will automatically populate with any Maven and Gradle projects in your workspace that are configured with the Liberty Maven / Liberty Gradle plugins. If you do not have any apps in your current workspace, try importing one like the "Getting Started" Open Liberty app here: https://github.com/openliberty/guide-getting-started. Once imported, refresh the Dashboard tab by clicking the refresh icon in the top right.
