[#SUB_TAG_0]
== Password Utilities 1.1

   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.
```
The new passwordUtilities-1.1 feature has been created to no longer start the federatedRegistry-1.0 feature or the JCA / connectors features. The new feature is part of core edition, whereas the passwordUtilities-1.0 feature is part of base edition.
```
   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)
```
Stand-alone user registries will no longer be forcefully federated, which sometimes results in slightly different behavior. The password utilities APIs can now be used in core edition.
```
   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.
```
Add the passwordUtilities-1.1 feature to the list of features in the server.xml file:

<featureManager>
    <feature>passwordUtilities-1.1</feature>
</featureManager>
```
   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?
`https://openliberty.io/docs/latest/reference/feature/passwordUtilities-1.0.html`

[#SUB_TAG_1]
== Use Issuer Claim for Selecting Which openidConnectClient Configuration to Use for a JWT Inbound Propagation Request

   
   - A sentence or two that introduces the update to someone new to the general technology/concept.

     With this release, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 feature supports using the issuer claim from the JWT or JWS access token for selecting which openidConnectClient configuration to use for a JWT inbound propagation request.

   - What was the problem before and how does your update make their life better? (Why should they care?)

     Prior to this release, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 feature did not support using the issuer claim from the JWT or JWS access token for selecting which openidConnectClient configuration to use for a JWT inbound propagation request. To overcome this, complicated authFilter(s) were required if more than one issuer was used for the same resource. With this release, the OpenID Connect Client 1.0 feature can be configured with simpler openidConnectClient elements for each required issuer.

   - Briefly explain how to make your update work. Include screenshots, diagrams, and/or code snippets, and provide a `server.xml` snippet.

> A Liberty OpenID Connect Relying Party will automatically use the issuer claim from a JWT or JWS access token to select the `openidConnectClient` configuration with a matching `issuer` attribute. For example, for an issuer claim value of `"https://hostname/op1"` and a server.xml file configured with,
>
>     <openidConnectClient id="RP1" issuer="https://hostname/op1"  ... />
>     <openidConnectClient id="RP2" issuer="https://hostname/op2" authFilterRef="rp2filter" .../>
>
>     <authFilter id="rp2filter">
>       ...
>     </authFilter>
>
>The RP1 configuration is selected as long as the "rp2filter" does not apply to the request. Therefore, an attempt to find which openidConnectClient configuration applies to the request will be done using the following algorithm:
>
> 1. If the auth filter for a openidConnectClient matches the request, choose that configuration.
> 2. Check the issuer from the JWT against the issuers of all config elements. If the issuer from the JWT matches a single openidConnectClient configuration element, choose that configuration.
> 3. If the issuer from the JWT matches the issuer of multiple openidConnectClient configuration elements, choose the first configuration matched.
> 4. If the issuer does not match the issuer of any configuration elements, choose between all of the config elements in a non-deterministic manner.

   - Where can they find out more about this specific update (eg Open Liberty docs, Javadoc) and/or the wider technology?

      For more information about OpenID Connect Client refer to the [OpenID Connect Client specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html).
